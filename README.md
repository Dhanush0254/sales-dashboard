# Sales Dashboard 📊

Hey! 👋 Welcome to **Sales Dashboard**.

This is a frontend project I built to demonstrate how modern web applications can be structured cleanly and professionally using **Atomic Design**. Instead of dumping everything into one page, this project focuses on **scalability, readability, and real-world architecture**.

The dashboard visualizes yearly sales performance and shows how data can be presented clearly using interactive charts.

---

## 💡 What Makes This Special?

I didn’t want to build just another chart page. This project focuses on **how** things are built, not just **what** is shown.

* **Atomic Design Architecture:**  
  The entire UI follows Atomic Design principles — from basic buttons (Atoms) to complex charts (Organisms) and full page layouts (Templates).

* **Clean Component Separation:**  
  Each responsibility is separated properly, making the project easy to extend, debug, and scale.

* **Year-wise Sales Visualization:**  
  Sales data for **2022, 2023, and 2024** is visualized using interactive charts so users can quickly understand trends.

* **Modern UI with Tailwind CSS:**  
  The interface is clean, responsive, and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Tech)

* **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Charts:** Recharts
* **Architecture:** Atomic Design (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates)

## 📊 Sales Data

The sales values used in this project are **mock data inspired by Kaggle datasets**.  
They are used only for demonstration and visualization purposes.
